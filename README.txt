Description

This is an implementation of the EMUS algorithm for recombining data 
from umbrella sampling calculations and other data sources coming from
biased probability densities.  The code is currently in open Beta,
please contact the author at `thiede [at symbol] uchicago [dot] edu` with 
any bugs, errors, or questions.

For usage and documentations, see the HTML documentation, which can be 
accessed by opening docs/html/index.html in a browser.
We are currently working on hosting the documentation online; this README
will be updated with a link once that is accomplished.

If you are using this code, please also cite the EMUS paper, which can be
found on [arxiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04505/) or the [Journal of Chemical
Physics](http://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4960649?journalCode=jcp).
