This is an implementation of the EMUS algorithm for recombining data 
from umbrella sampling calculations and other data sources coming from
biased probability densities.  The code is still very much in Alpha,
please contact the author at `thiede [at symbol] uchicago [dot] edu` with 
any bugs, errors, or questions.

For usage and documentations, see the HTML documentation, which can be 
accessed by opening html_doc/html/index.html in a browser.

If you are using this code, please also cite the [EMUS paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04505/)
